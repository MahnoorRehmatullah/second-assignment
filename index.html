    <h1><dfn>Boycott Israel Products</dfn></h1>
    <p><strong> Israel</strong> has killed over 21,000 Palestinians since 7<sup>th</sup> of October 2023.
        The <strong>Israeli</strong> military <q>repeatedly exploded P<sub>4</sub> white phosphorus munitions in the air
            over populated areas, killing and injuring civilians, and damaging civilian structures, including a school,
            a market, a humanitarian aid warehouse and a hospital</q>, <strong>Israel’s</strong>
        technological advancement, its support by the United States and some other European nations, disharmony among
        the Muslim states, and its weak military strength have coerced the pro-<b><em>Palestinian</em></b> people to
        look for other means to stop <strong>Israel’s</strong> atrocities. Hence, the call for a boycott of
        pro-<strong>Israel</strong> and <strong>Israeli</strong> products has become an effective way to protest against
        <strong>Israel’s</strong> massacre in <b><em>Palestinian</em></b> land. For this purpose, the
        <b><em>Palestinian</em></b> people have developed the <q><i>Boycott, Divestment, and Sanction
                <abbr title="Boycott, Divestment, and Sanction">(BDS)</abbr> movement</i>.</q>

    <p>we have to boycott <strong>Israel</strong> products for ur ownself and for ur own deen. The kids out there who
        are being killed by those <strong>Israel</strong> soldiers will definitely be rewarded by a beautiful place an
        everlasting place with lots of gifts by Allah Almighty for them which is absolutely jannah. Our sisters brothers
        are dying out there and amount of deads are too much. Boycotting <strong>Israel</strong> products can satisfy
        you if the <strong>Israel</strong> products rate of selling will get down and just cause of ur selfcontrol on
        buying those products will low their budget for having bullets in their guns bombing the buildings. Palestine
        will be free Inn Shaa Allah.

    <p>Some brands like, <br><del> HP, Starbucks,Johnson, Nestle, Motorola, McDonald’s, L’Oréal, Coca-cola, Nokia,
            Sprite, KitKat,
            Nido, Nescafe,Burger King, Hardee's, Subway, Lays,Tang, Ariel </del>etc are either strong supporters of
        <strong>Israel</strong> or are funded by <strong>Israel</strong>.In case you have a doubt, one easy way is to
        check for the barcode. Any barcode starting from 729 is related to <strong>Israel</strong>, though not
        necessarily manufactured there, but it can be related to <strong>Israel</strong>. Instead of these
        <strong>Israel</strong> products we should have to use these pakistani products like<ins> Haleeb, Pakola,Vital,
            Tea, Sweet Creme.</ins>

    <p>Consumers have the power to influence political as well as economic decisions, as this results in revenue.
        Boycotting <strong>Israeli</strong> products can be seen as an act of solidarity with the brothers and sisters
        of Palestine.Though boycotting the brands that are in daily use can be a tough decision, but it is a necessity about
        the situation, as it has been stated by the Holy Prophet (PBUH) that
    <blockquote> <q>if anyone sees anything wrong, one must try
            to stop it by hand, if not by the tongue, and even if that is not possible, one must think about that thing
            as
            evil in the heart.</q></blockquote>
